// CAN THE BAKED ANCHOR OVERRIDE A DOOR THE CALLER CHOSE ON PURPOSE?
//
//   node tools/m59-exactexit-test.mjs
//
// Offline. Reads source and the baked map; opens no socket, starts no broker.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `leaveViaAny` widens a boundary on purpose: `spreadEdges` offers
// every square that crosses it, and the baked anchor is unshifted to the FRONT because the
// bake planned a walkable line to it while a scanned square only has floor on it. There is
// a comment in orderExits saying so in capitals — "THE BAKED ANCHOR GOES FIRST, AND
// DISTANCE MUST NOT OUTRANK IT" — and it is right, for the case it was written for: a wide
// wall whose crossings are alternatives.
//
// THEY ARE NOT ALTERNATIVES WHEN THE DESTINATION IS SPLIT. Measured on prod 2026-08-27,
// Castle Victoria into Upstairs Castle Victoria:
//
//     door (19,2) lands (28,8)   <- THE BAKED ANCHOR, and the wrong island
//     door (19,1) lands (28,8)
//     door (17,2) lands (23,8)   <- where the quarry is
//     door (17,1) lands (23,8)
//
// `crossSameRoomIsland` filtered correctly down to the two doors that land on the quarry's
// side. The anchor then won the ordering, the character crossed by (19,2), and the keeper
// reported "returned to the room, but not to the quarry's connected side" — a flawless round
// trip back to where it started. Three of six characters did that in a single window, and
// the group killed nothing all night.
//
// So the law being pinned is narrow: when a caller passes `exact`, the door set it named is
// the whole permitted set — no anchor injected, no spreading to other squares on the wall —
// and `exact` is OFF everywhere else so ordinary crossings keep the behaviour that makes a
// wide wall reliable. And it must still FALL BACK: narrowing to nothing would strand a
// character at a boundary it could otherwise have crossed, which is worse than a wrong door.
