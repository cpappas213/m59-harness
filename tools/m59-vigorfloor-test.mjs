// CAN AN OPERATOR ACTUALLY SET THE VIGOR FLOOR?
//
//   node tools/m59-vigorfloor-test.mjs
//
// Offline. Reads source and the local policy file; opens no socket, starts no broker.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `fight_above_vigor` is documented, schema'd, accepted by the
// broker, stored in the roster, and reported back by `autopilot status` — and for every
// value below 100 it did nothing at all. `fightFloor()` is
//
//     Math.max(MIN_FIGHT_VIGOR, p.vigorFloor ?? plan.vigorFloor ?? p.fightAboveVigor ?? 0)
//
// so a clamp silently raised it. The policy read back exactly what was set and the
// character behaved as though it had not been. That is the failure mode this repository
// keeps naming — a setting that reads as applied and changes nothing — and it had gone so
// far that substrate/policy.local.json carried a key called `why_the_floor_is_100`
// explaining that 80 was not settable, rather than the clamp being moved.
//
// Measured on prod 2026-08-28, before the change: eighteen of twenty characters reporting
// `cannot fight` against a floor of 100, ten consecutive half-hourly reports with zero
// toughers, and fleet max health falling 1,006 -> 930 as they died without ever engaging.
// The escape hatch only fires on an EMPTY larder, so a character holding one mushroom
// against a floor of 100 was deadlocked with food in its pack.
//
// THE LAW: 80 is REST_VIGOR_CAP x 200, exactly what resting alone delivers, so it is the
// highest floor a character can always reach unaided and the last one that cannot
// deadlock. A floor above it is a bet on the food chain and must remain expressible; a
// floor at or below it must be honoured rather than quietly raised.
