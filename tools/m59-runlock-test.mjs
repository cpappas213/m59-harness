//   node tools/m59-runlock-test.mjs
//
// Offline. No socket, no broker, no roster — and it never touches a real lock, because
// M59_RUNLOCK_DIR is pointed at scratch before the module is imported.
//
// WHAT THIS GUARDS. On 2026-08-21 three copies of `m59-solo-run.mjs` were driving the same
// twenty-one shadow characters at once. One had been "stopped" sixty-five minutes earlier
// through a wrapper that killed the shell and left the node process; one had been killed at
// launch by a `tee` that could not open its output, took EPIPE on stdout, and carried on for
// an hour with nowhere to write. They fought over the same bodies, and every collision
// arrived in the transit book as
//
//   movement cancelled by a newer command
//
// which is exactly what a genuine survival interrupt looks like. A long investigation into a
// travel bug was, in part, an investigation into three copies of itself.
//
// The two properties below are the fix, and both of them erode silently:
//
//   1. A SECOND RUN IS REFUSED, by name, while a first is genuinely alive.
//   2. A STALE CLAIM IS TAKEN OVER, because refusing for ever on a dead process is its own
//      failure — and `exit` handlers do not run on SIGKILL, so stale claims are normal.
//
// It should fail the day a fleet tool stops taking the lock.
