//
// ======================== THE INCIDENT THIS SUITE IS BUILT FROM ========================
//
// 2026-08-27, during a five-inn pilgrimage on the SHADOW fleet. Ten characters reached
// Outside Castle Victoria — journeys `ok`, 133 to 139 seconds, objective complete — and then
// eleven minutes later, WITHIN TWO SECONDS OF EACH OTHER, they all crossed back out of it
// into Ukgoth, the most dangerous room on their route. They were idle, `roam: false`,
// `hunt: null`, `assignedRoom: null`. Nothing in their own policy could move them.
//
// The keeper's journal said why, in plain words:
//
//     "Scooter is fighting Morpheus — travelling to assist"
//
// Scooter and Animal are PROD characters. Aaaa and Cccc are SHADOW characters. Different
// accounts, on different servers. And on disk:
//
//     substrate/active-conflicts.json
//     { "Morpheus": { room: 544, "Valley of Ileria", reporter: "Animal", ... } }
//
// ONE FILE, for the whole machine, and two fleets run here. The route from room 2 to room
// 544 passes through Ukgoth, which is exactly how far they got.
//
// TWO INDEPENDENT DEFECTS, and each is enough on its own:
//
//   STORAGE — the book was `active-conflicts.json`, not `active-conflicts-<fleet>.json`,
//     while every other per-fleet artefact here is already named for its fleet.
//   BEHAVIOUR — the candidate filter was `cf.reporter !== myName`, i.e. "not me", and
//     nothing else. Answering a stranger's call is wrong even when the call is in the right
//     file, and this is the same rule `m59-follow.mjs` already applies to "follow me": the
//     speaker is checked against the ROSTER, never against the text.
//
// It should fail the day either half is loosened.
