// ABILITY TRACKING — the cache, the pushes, and the record. Offline, no server,
// safe to run any time:
//
//   node tools/m59-ability-test.mjs
//
// Two halves, and the first is the one that was broken:
//
//   THE WIRE. Ability levels arrive in stat groups 3 (spells) and 4 (skills), which
//   are STATS_LIST and therefore carry the spell's or skill's OBJECT ID. They were
//   being filed in `statsById` under "4.7" and nothing else, because that map indexes
//   a stat by name only `if (s.name)` and `name` comes from STAT_NAMES, which covers
//   groups 1 and 2. So `abilityOf(c, 'axe wielding')` searched by name, found
//   nothing, and returned null — every time, for every character, since the beginning.
//   Nothing noticed, because null is also the honest "not read yet" answer and
//   weaponRanking falls back to a name score for it.
//
//   THE RECORD. Reading abilities costs four requests and 1.2s, so nothing read them
//   often, so nobody had a BEFORE to compare against. The server pushes every change
//   (ChangeSkillAbility -> DrawStatSkill, player.kod:7343), which means the delta can
//   be logged as it happens instead of reconstructed from two polls that never ran.
