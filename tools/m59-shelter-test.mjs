// ======================== WHAT THIS PINS ========================
//
// The travel doctrine answers everything except a person and dying the same way: take the next
// route-adjacent wall, rest to full, carry on. On 2026-08-27 a run of twenty-one produced twelve
// deaths and NOTHING ON DISK could say whether that doctrine had fired — whether a wall was ever
// chosen, how hurt the character was when it chose, how far away the wall was, or whether it got
// there. Those are four different faults with four different fixes and they all render as "died
// travelling".
//
// The operator asked for three things and each is one group below:
//
//   (A) the health at the moment the decision is made, with BOTH squares, so the run for cover
//       can be recreated rather than inferred
//   (B) how far away the chosen wall is — and the distance that matters is how far the
//       character has to WALK, not how far the wall sits off the planned road
//   (C) distance per second around the time of death: was it still making progress
//
// And one rule change: seek shelter below 100% health rather than below 95%.
