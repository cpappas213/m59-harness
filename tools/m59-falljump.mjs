// OFFLINE. Reads the baked geometry; no server, no broker.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. There are places in this world joined only by running off a high ledge,
// keeping your horizontal speed, and landing on middle ground across a gulley the floor
// does not span. Ukgoth is one: the ONLY doorway to Castle Victoria is at row 1, col 27,
// on a cliff top reached by a run-and-fall from about 36,16 to about 38,10, and it is
// notorious among new players. Nothing in this repository could express that. The mover
// knows one vertical rule — `MAX_STEP_HEIGHT`, which gates CLIMBING — and a fall is not a
// climb, so a legitimate traversal the whole world uses was simply invisible.
//
// The cost of that gap was not a missing route. It was a WRONG one: with no way to say
// "you may only reach the north-west of Ukgoth by falling", the router found the doorway
// anyway, through a wall, because `moverStepLands` is over-permissive on that boundary
// (see m59-clipsweep.mjs — 211 rooms of it). Twenty-one characters "arrived" at Castle
// Victoria in 17-23 seconds through solid rock, and it was read as proof that routing
// worked. A model with no concept of a mechanic does not decline to use it; it invents
// something else and reports success.
//
// DECLARED, NOT DERIVED — AND THAT IS A MEASUREMENT, NOT LAZINESS.
//
// The physics are all known: GRAVITY_ACCELERATION = -5 * FINENESS, FALL_VELOCITY_0 =
// -FINENESS * 2/3 (clientd3d/moveobj.h:15, move.h:17), horizontal speed 5 squares/second
// at a run. So the arc can be computed. It was, against the one jump whose real endpoints
// an operator supplied — and the terrain there descends in STEPS which the fall curve
// tracks within about 30 client units, a thirtieth of a square:
//
//     d 2.5  floor 5872   faller 4891      <- the ledge ends
//     d 3.0  floor 4576   faller 4541      <- 35 units of clearance
//     d 4.0  floor 3712   faller 3687      <- 25 units
//
// A model whose margin is 25 units decides "makeable" on rounding. So `physics()` is
// reported as EVIDENCE and never as a verdict: `traversable()` answers from the declared
// table, and the arithmetic is there to argue with, not to gate on. If somebody later
// validates the model against a dozen known jumps, the gate can move — that day, not now.
//
// A DECLARATION IS A CLAIM ABOUT SOMEBODY ELSE'S SERVER, so it carries who saw it and
// when, the same as substrate/m59-crossings.json. An entry nobody has walked is a guess
// with a citation, and worth less than no entry at all.
