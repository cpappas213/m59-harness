// THE FIGHT-BACK EDICT. Offline, no server, safe any time:
//
//   node tools/m59-fightback-test.mjs
//
// "If dithering and being attacked for more than ten seconds, fight back if it is smaller
// than you." An operator's order, 2026-08-27, given after watching six characters stand in
// one corner of the Valley of Ileria being chewed on while their keepers were each inside a
// walk they could not finish. The branch that hits back already existed in passFarm; it was
// never reached because the pass never ended.
//
// Two halves on two clocks, and this pins both against a hand-built keeper:
//
//   * `fightBackCheck` — the WATCHDOG half. Keeps an attack episode (health going down with
//     something attackable in reach), and when it is older than the edict pulls the handbrake
//     once per pass and asks for a fight. It decides nothing else: off by default, silent
//     below the flee line, silent while already fighting, silent under an errand.
//   * `passFightBack` — the PASS half. Answers with the nearest thing in reach that the
//     fleet's engagement band would let this character fight, before any wall, pull or walk;
//     steps aside below the flee line so the survival ladder is next; refuses what the band
//     refuses, and leaves that to the ladder too.
//
// Drives the REAL prototype methods with a fake `this`, the way m59-passorder-test does.
