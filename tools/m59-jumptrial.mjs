// The declared fall-jump at 36,16 -> 38,10 is the one move on the road to Castle Victoria
// that cannot be walked, and missing it is not a slow crossing — it is terminal. The body
// lands on the gulley floor at 3200, the shelf it wanted is at 3840, and 640 units of rise
// against a 384 step limit means there is no way back up. From in there the strict geometry
// reaches 681 squares and neither Castle Victoria nor the Cragged Mountains is among them.
//
// WHY A HARNESS RATHER THAN A FIX. The obstacle is not geometry, which is fixed and known,
// but TRAFFIC: Ukgoth accumulates trolls, and a Guardian of Zjiria standing on the landing
// is a moving target that a static route cannot plan around. So the question is not "what is
// the right line" but "which approach succeeds most often against a room that will not hold
// still", and that is a measurement, not an argument.
//
// THE SHAPE, which is the operator's:
//
//   * every character waits on its own safe spot, queued back from the take-off, so a
//     character waiting its turn is not itself part of the traffic;
//   * ONE goes forward at a time, attempts the jump under a named strategy, and is sent back
//     to its spot whether it made it or not;
//   * every attempt records what was in the way and whether the thing in the way was MOVING,
//     because "a troll was there" and "a troll walked into me" want different answers.
//
// The ledger is substrate/jumptrials.jsonl, append-only, one line per attempt. It never
// records a character name — see the redaction note on `line()`.

// Each says where to take off from and where to aim. `wait` is the only one that looks at the

//
// The take-off alternatives are all on the same ledge and the same floor as 36,16 — verified
// against floorBaseAtClient, not guessed — so every one of them is a jump somebody could
// actually stand and make, not a new claim about the map.
// MEASURED, AND THE GEOMETRY QUESTION IS CLOSED.
//
// The first hundred attempts settled it. By take-off square, jumps actually attempted:
//
//     36,16    9 jumps, 9 made, 100%   landed 39,12 every time
//     35,16    3 jumps, 0 made,   0%   landed 38,13, the gulley
//     37,15    3 jumps, 0 made,   0%   landed 38,13
//
// and with a clear line, 9 of 9. With anything on the line, 0 of 6. So there is nothing left
// to tune about WHERE to jump from: the operator declared 36,16 by walking it, and a square
// either side — same ledge, same floor, one step — never clears the gulley. Aiming a square
// short of the landing is fine, so it is the TAKE-OFF that is exact, not the target.
//
// `strafe_n` and `strafe_s` are kept as controls rather than deleted. They cost six attempts
// a run and they are the evidence that the declared square matters; a refuted idea that
// leaves no trace gets re-proposed.
//
// What is left is TIMING, because the only thing that fails a jump from 36,16 is something
// standing on the line. These vary how long to wait and how strict to be about 'clear'.

//
// The obvious design — and the one this started with — is one character per safe spot, queued
// back from the take-off. It does not work, and the reason is a property of what a safe spot IS.
//
// A safe wall is a square where the two grids DISAGREE: the BSP admits a body, the coarse grid
// the monsters path on refuses it. That is the whole mechanism. But the strict predicate — the
// one that matches what a walker can actually do — also requires a coarse-walkable destination.
// So a safe spot is, by construction, an ISLAND to it. Measured on the ten spots this tool
// first chose: seven strictly reach exactly ONE square, their own.
//
// Parked there, a character cannot walk to the ledge at all. The permissive predicate says it
// can — `moverStepLands` gates on `standable`, and that is true for all 4,686 squares in this
// room — so the walker sets off, meets a wall the model does not have, and grinds along it.
// Watched from the client: bodies hugging the EAST wall while the jump is to the south-west.
//
// So the queue is ordinary connected ground that STRICTLY reaches the take-off, and among
// those the squares with the most walls against them: defensible AND reachable, rather than
// defensible and marooned.
