  // 384 -- so a retry from a different angle is not a different attempt, it is the same
  // attempt at a body that still cannot run.

  // It is only ever raised AFTER resting on the take-off ledge has already failed to
  // recover vigor, so by the time a caller sees it the cheap remedy has been tried. What

  // caller sees it both sides of the blocker have been tried.
