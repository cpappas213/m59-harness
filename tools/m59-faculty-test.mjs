// WITH NO BOT ATTACHED, THE KEEPER STILL OWNS EVERYTHING THAT KEEPS A CHARACTER ALIVE.
//
//   node tools/m59-faculty-test.mjs
//
// This is the guard on the carve-out, and it is deliberately the cheapest thing in it.
//
// `meridian59-dum-bot` moves the DIRECTIONAL half of a character out of this repository —
// what to hunt, which room to stand in, when to bank. The half that must not move is the
// half bound to a one-second clock: identity, mortality, survival, recovery, re-arming,
// Underworld escape. The split is real and the seam already exists in the keeper's own
// pass ordering (`0 identity`, `1 dead`, `2 in danger`, `3 hurt but safe`, `4 work`) — a
// bot's rules start at 4 and there is nothing above it.
//
// The risk is not that someone moves survival out on purpose. It is that it erodes: a
// faculty is handed over "just for this errand", a lease is added without a fallback, an
// `inert` grows a new caller, and one day a character with no bot attached stands in a
// monster room doing nothing because whatever used to drive it now lives in another
// repository that is not running. That failure is silent from both sides — the harness
// reports a healthy keeper, the bot reports that it is not driving anything.
//
// So this asserts the property directly and offline: with nothing attached, every faculty
// answers `keeper`, and the ladder that keeps a character alive is reachable in the
// source. It should FAIL the day a survival decision moves out. That is its whole job.
//
// It reads the keeper's SOURCE rather than importing it, because importing m59-autopilot
// is cheap but importing m59-broker is not — it takes the fleet lock and starts timers —
// and the ordering assertions below are about the file's structure, which is the thing
// that would change if somebody moved a branch.
